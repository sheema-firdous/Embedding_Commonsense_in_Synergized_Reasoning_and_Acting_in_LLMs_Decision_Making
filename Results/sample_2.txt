🤖 Automating exploration to find the object...

> Auto-Command: go to armchair 1
------------------------------------------------------------ 
 You arrive at armchair 1. On the armchair 1, you see a cellphone 1, a creditcard 1, a pillow 2, and a pillow 1. 
 ------------------------------------------------------------
LLM Reason: The sub-goal of finding the vase is not achieved because there is no vase mentioned in the current observation, which includes a cellphone, a creditcard, a pillow, and another pillow on the armchair. 
Completion Status: No

> Auto-Command: go to cabinet 4
------------------------------------------------------------ 
 You arrive at cabinet 4. The cabinet 4 is closed. 
 ------------------------------------------------------------
LLM Reason: The sub-goal of finding the vase is not achieved because the cabinet is closed, and there's no indication that the vase is inside or visible. 
Completion Status: No

> Auto-Command: open cabinet 4
------------------------------------------------------------ 
 You open the cabinet 4. The cabinet 4 is open. In it, you see a box 2. 
 ------------------------------------------------------------
LLM Reason: The sub-goal to find the vase is not achieved because the observation only mentions a box, not a vase. The cabinet's contents do not match the target object. 
Completion Status: No

> Auto-Command: go to cabinet 3
------------------------------------------------------------ 
 Nothing happens. 
 ------------------------------------------------------------
LLM Reason: The observation does not provide any information about finding the vase, so it's unclear if the sub-goal has been achieved. 
Completion Status: No

> Auto-Command: go to cabinet 2
------------------------------------------------------------ 
 You arrive at cabinet 2. The cabinet 2 is closed. 
 ------------------------------------------------------------
LLM Reason: The sub-goal of finding the vase is not achieved since the cabinet is closed and there's no indication of the vase being present or found. 
Completion Status: No

> Auto-Command: open cabinet 2
------------------------------------------------------------ 
 You open the cabinet 2. The cabinet 2 is open. In it, you see nothing. 
 ------------------------------------------------------------
LLM Reason: Since the cabinet is open and nothing is seen, it's unlikely that the vase is in the cabinet, but it doesn't confirm its absence in the entire room. 
Completion Status: No

> Auto-Command: go to cabinet 1
------------------------------------------------------------ 
 Nothing happens. 
 ------------------------------------------------------------
LLM Reason: The observation that "Nothing happens" does not provide any information about finding the vase, so it's unclear if the sub-goal is achieved. 
Completion Status: No

> Auto-Command: go to drawer 5
------------------------------------------------------------ 
 You arrive at drawer 5. The drawer 5 is closed. 
 ------------------------------------------------------------
LLM Reason: The sub-goal of finding the vase cannot be achieved with the current observation since the drawer is closed, and there's no indication that the vase is in the drawer or has been found. 
Completion Status: No

> Auto-Command: open drawer 5
------------------------------------------------------------ 
 You open the drawer 5. The drawer 5 is open. In it, you see nothing. 
 ------------------------------------------------------------
LLM Reason: The observation that the drawer is open and contains nothing indicates that the vase is not in the drawer, which is a step towards finding the vase but not the final step. 
Completion Status: No

> Auto-Command: go to drawer 4
------------------------------------------------------------ 
 You arrive at drawer 4. The drawer 4 is closed. 
 ------------------------------------------------------------
LLM Reason: The current observation does not provide any information about finding a vase, and the drawer being closed does not directly relate to the sub-goal of finding a vase. 
Completion Status: No

> Auto-Command: open drawer 4
------------------------------------------------------------ 
 You open the drawer 4. The drawer 4 is open. In it, you see nothing. 
 ------------------------------------------------------------
LLM Reason: The observation that the drawer contains nothing indicates that the vase is not present in the drawer, which means the sub-goal of finding the vase is not achieved by opening this drawer. 
Completion Status: No

> Auto-Command: go to drawer 3
------------------------------------------------------------ 
 You arrive at drawer 3. The drawer 3 is closed. 
 ------------------------------------------------------------
LLM Reason: The current observation that you arrive at a drawer does not directly relate to finding a vase, so the sub-goal is not achieved. 
Completion Status: No

> Auto-Command: open drawer 3
------------------------------------------------------------ 
 You open the drawer 3. The drawer 3 is open. In it, you see nothing. 
 ------------------------------------------------------------

> Auto-Command: go to drawer 2
------------------------------------------------------------ 
 You arrive at drawer 2. The drawer 2 is closed. 
 ------------------------------------------------------------
LLM Reason: The sub-goal of finding the vase is not achieved because the current observation indicates you are at a drawer, which doesn't necessarily contain the vase, and the drawer is closed, making it unlikely to find the vase there. 
Completion Status: No

> Auto-Command: open drawer 2
------------------------------------------------------------ 
 You open the drawer 2. The drawer 2 is open. In it, you see nothing. 
 ------------------------------------------------------------

Completion Status: No

> Auto-Command: go to drawer 1
------------------------------------------------------------ 
 You arrive at drawer 1. The drawer 1 is closed. 
 ------------------------------------------------------------
LLM Reason: Since the current sub-goal is to find the vase and the observation indicates that you are at a drawer, it is unlikely that the vase is in the drawer because it is closed, which would prevent the vase from being visible or accessible. 
Completion Status: No

> Auto-Command: open drawer 1
------------------------------------------------------------ 
 You open the drawer 1. The drawer 1 is open. In it, you see nothing.

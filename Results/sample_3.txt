find mug

### Visible Scene Objects
['cabinet 9', 'cabinet 8', 'cabinet 7', 'cabinet 6', 'cabinet 5', 'cabinet 4', 'cabinet 3', 'cabinet 2', 'cabinet 1', 'coffeemachine 1', 'countertop 3', 'countertop 2', 'countertop 1', 'drawer 9', 'drawer 8', 'drawer 7', 'drawer 6', 'drawer 5', 'drawer 4', 'drawer 3', 'drawer 2', 'drawer 1', 'fridge 1', 'garbagecan 1', 'microwave 1', 'shelf 3', 'shelf 2', 'shelf 1', 'sinkbasin 1', 'stoveburner 4', 'stoveburner 3', 'stoveburner 2', 'stoveburner 1', 'toaster 1']

### Common-Sense Knowledge
- AtLocation: cabinet, cupboard, store, bar, mug

### ANALYSIS AND MAPPING

My direct mapping approach will identify objects in the scene that directly match locations from the common-sense knowledge.

- Cabinet from knowledge matches 'cabinet 1', 'cabinet 2', 'cabinet 3', 'cabinet 4', 'cabinet 5', 'cabinet 6', 'cabinet 7', 'cabinet 8', 'cabinet 9' in the scene.
- Shelf is not directly listed in the knowledge but cupboard is so shelf will not count; however cabinet still matches.
- Bar from knowledge does not match since 'bar' isn't present in the scene.
- Store from knowledge and 'mug' do not match directly.

### PRIORITY LIST

Based on the direct mapping, I will prioritize exploring the cabinets, as they directly match the location where a mug would be likely stored. I will also include other possible locations where a mug might be placed, based on common household items like the coffee machine.

Recommended locations to explore: ["cabinet 9", "cabinet 8", "cabinet 7", "cabinet 6", "cabinet 5", "cabinet 4", "cabinet 3", "cabinet 2", "cabinet 1", "coffeemachine 1"]

🤖 Automating exploration to find the object...

> Auto-Command: go to cabinet 9
------------------------------------------------------------ 
 You arrive at cabinet 9. The cabinet 9 is closed. 
 ------------------------------------------------------------
LLM Reason: The sub-goal of finding a mug is not achieved because the current observation shows a cabinet that is closed, indicating no access to objects inside. 
Completion Status: No

> Auto-Command: open cabinet 9
------------------------------------------------------------ 
 You open the cabinet 9. The cabinet 9 is open. In it, you see nothing. 
 ------------------------------------------------------------
LLM Reason: Since the cabinet is open and nothing is seen inside, it is unlikely that the mug is within the cabinet, and thus the sub-goal of finding the mug is not achieved by searching in this cabinet. 
Completion Status: No

> Auto-Command: go to cabinet 8
------------------------------------------------------------ 
 You arrive at cabinet 8. The cabinet 8 is closed. 
 ------------------------------------------------------------
LLM Reason: The current observation does not provide any information about a mug, so it's unlikely that the sub-goal is achieved. 
Completion Status: No

> Auto-Command: open cabinet 8
------------------------------------------------------------ 
 You open the cabinet 8. The cabinet 8 is open. In it, you see nothing. 
 ------------------------------------------------------------
LLM Reason: The observation shows that the cabinet is open but contains nothing, so the sub-goal of finding a mug in the cabinet has not been achieved. 
Completion Status: No

> Auto-Command: go to cabinet 7
------------------------------------------------------------ 
 You arrive at cabinet 7. The cabinet 7 is closed. 
 ------------------------------------------------------------
LLM Reason: The sub-goal of finding a mug cannot be achieved with the current observation since the cabinet is closed and there is no indication of a mug being present or visible. 
Completion Status: No

> Auto-Command: open cabinet 7
------------------------------------------------------------ 
 You open the cabinet 7. The cabinet 7 is open. In it, you see a plate 2. 
 ------------------------------------------------------------
LLM Reason: The observation does not mention a mug, so the sub-goal of finding a mug is not achieved by opening the cabinet and seeing a plate. 
Completion Status: No

> Auto-Command: go to cabinet 6
------------------------------------------------------------ 
 You arrive at cabinet 6. The cabinet 6 is closed. 
 ------------------------------------------------------------
LLM Reason: The cabinet being closed does not provide any information about the presence or absence of a mug, so the sub-goal cannot be confirmed as achieved by this observation. 
Completion Status: No

> Auto-Command: open cabinet 6
------------------------------------------------------------ 
 You open the cabinet 6. The cabinet 6 is open. In it, you see a mug 3. 
 ------------------------------------------------------------
LLM Reason: The observation shows a mug in the cabinet, which matches the name of the object we're searching for, ignoring the numeric identifier. 
Completion Status: Yes

🤖 LLM Reasoning on ConceptNet Response:

### Analyzing 'Common-Sense Knowledge' and 'Visible Scene Objects'

From the Common-Sense Knowledge:

- The property 'cool' is a characteristic associated with a specific object type.
- The manner 'cool' has an implied temperature meaning and is not a general descriptor, implying some sort of temperature-reducing appliance.

Comparing with the 'Visible Scene Objects':

- Objects with 'cool' property from knowledge could directly map to scene objects like appliances designed to keep things cool.
- Direct synonyms for 'cool' objects from knowledge should match corresponding objects in the scene.

Based on this analysis, a direct match found in the scene objects is the 'fridge 1', which is an appliance used for cooling.

### Mapping and Prioritizing Search Plan

Matching 'MannerOf: cool' Knowledge with the Visible Scene Objects:
- 'cool' is associated directly with some types of appliances.
- However, 'cool' is also associated with temperature-reducing appliances, such as refrigerators or air conditioning units.

Based on the given scene objects, there is a direct object that matches this characteristic: 
- 'fridge 1'

Since 'fridge 1' matches the direct synonym for 'cool' in the scene, it should be prioritized.

### Prioritized List of Objects to Explore

Recommended locations to explore: ["fridge 1", "coffeemachine 1", "microwave 1", "toaster 1", "cabinet 1", "cabinet 2", "cabinet 3", "cabinet 4", "cabinet 5", "cabinet 6", "cabinet 7", "cabinet 8", "cabinet 9", "countertop 1", "countertop 2", "countertop 3", "drawer 1", "drawer 2", "drawer 3", "drawer 4", "drawer 5", "drawer 6", "drawer 7", "drawer 8", "drawer 9", "shelf 1", "shelf 2", "shelf 3", "sinkbasin 1", "stoveburner 1", "stoveburner 2", "stoveburner 3", "stoveburner 4", "garbagecan 1"]

Note: All objects from the original list are included in the final recommended list for exploration, except those that directly contradict the 'cool' property, as we could only verify a direct match for one object in the scene.
✅ Identified target appliance: fridge 1

> Auto-Command: go to fridge 1
------------------------------------------------------------ 
 You arrive at fridge 1. The fridge 1 is closed. 
 ------------------------------------------------------------

> Auto-Command: open fridge 1
------------------------------------------------------------ 
 You open the fridge 1. The fridge 1 is open. In it, you see a bowl 1, a egg 1, a potato 1, a tomato 3, a tomato 2, and a tomato 1. 
 ------------------------------------------------------------

> Auto-Command: inventory
📦 Confirmed in hand: 'mug 3'

> Auto-Command: cool mug 3 with fridge 1
------------------------------------------------------------ 
 You cool the mug 3 using the fridge 1. 
 ------------------------------------------------------------

LLM Reason: The sub-goal of getting a cool mug is achieved because the observation states that the mug was cooled using the fridge, which directly fulfills the requirement.

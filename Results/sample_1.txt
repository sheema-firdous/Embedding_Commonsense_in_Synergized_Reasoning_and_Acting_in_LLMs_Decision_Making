🤖 LLM Reasoning on ConceptNet Response:

### Current Sub-Goal
find laptop

### Visible Scene Objects
['armchair 2', 'armchair 1', 'diningtable 1', 'drawer 4', 'drawer 3', 'drawer 2', 'drawer 1', 'dresser 1', 'garbagecan 1', 'ottoman 1', 'sidetable 3', 'sidetable 2', 'sidetable 1', 'sofa 1']

### Common-Sense Knowledge
- AtLocation: desk, internet cafe, laptop

### YOUR REASONING:
Think: ConceptNet lists 'desk' and 'internet cafe' as likely locations for a laptop. 'desk' is a likely location where a laptop would be placed. However, none of the provided names are a direct match for either 'desk' or 'internet cafe'. However 'laptop' is mentioned, but it has the exact object we are searching, so there is a match.

### Recommended locations to explore:

  "diningtable 1", 
  "drawer 1", 
  "drawer 2", 
  "drawer 3", 
  "drawer 4",

> Auto-Command: go to armchair 2
------------------------------------------------------------ 
 You arrive at armchair 2. On the armchair 2, you see nothing.

Completion Status: No

> Auto-Command: go to armchair 1
------------------------------------------------------------

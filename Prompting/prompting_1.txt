Observation:
 -= Welcome to TextWorld, ALFRED! =-

You are in the middle of a room. Looking quickly around you, you see a coffeetable 1, a diningtable 1, a drawer 4, a drawer 3, a drawer 2, a drawer 1, a dresser 1, a garbagecan 1, a sidetable 2, a sidetable 1, and a sofa 1.

Your task is to: put two newspaper in sofa.
LLM Think: In order to put two newspapers in/on sofa, i need to first search for the newspaper. I can see multiple objects and locations in the current scene. I need to see most likely location of newspaper, and for that, I need to search newspaper on ConceptNet.

ConceptNet: 'newspaper':

LLM Think:Since I see the response, the newspaper is likely to be found in location sother than scene objects, because no matching location found. So what I can do is I sould see what does more likely to appear on the scene objects, maybe I can start from a dining table to see what things might be normally on dinning table. So lets search with Conceptnet again.

LLM Think: I see that I got no data for this, maybe I can search coffe table. Let's do it.

LLM Think: I see that coffee table can be used to put magazines, books that is closely related to the newspaper, so I should be exploring the coffe table first.

Your command: go to coffee table 1

Observation:
You arrive at coffee table 1. On the sidetable 1, you see a houseplant 1, and a newspaper 4.
LLM Think: Oh I found a newspaper: newspaper 4. Now I sould pick it up. 

Your command: take newspaper 4 from coffee table 1

Observation:
You pick up the newspaper 4 from the coffee table 1.
LLM Think: Okay now I have one newspaper, I need to put this to sofa. I should first go to sofa.

Your command: go to sofa 1

Observation:
You arrive at sofa 1. On the sofa 1, you see a keychain 1, and a pillow 1.
LLM Think: I have sofa in just front of me, I need to put this newspaper to the sofa so that i may go to find the second newspaper. Your command: move newspaper 4 to sofa 1

Observation:
You move the newspaper 4 to the sofa 1. 
LLM Think: Since the next step should be to find the secon d newspaper to put on the sofa, I need to again do the search. Since coffee table 1 had a newspaper, is there any other coffee table in the scene? No i see there was only one coffee table 1 in the scene that had only one newspaper. It means I need to explore the other locations to find the next newspaper. 
LLM Think: The locations i can explore are: a diningtable 1, a drawer 4, a drawer 3, a drawer 2, a drawer 1, a dresser 1, a garbagecan 1, a sidetable 2, a sidetable 1, But need to find the most likely location of newspaper (other than coffee table) to start with. I will use ConceptNet to query: table (instead of dinning table/side table just to make sure ConceptNet doesn't return empty arrays, bcz conceptnet fails sometimes for two-words phrase/ concepts)

Your command: go to dinning table 1
Observation:
You arrive at diningtable 1. On the diningtable 1, you see a laptop 1.
